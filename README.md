This program needs java 8 to run.
how to run
- mvn clean test
-- output will be on console

Things to improve with more time
- output format can be better 
- getDomainName method can be better and more generic (using some libraries).
- could have written more and usefull unit tests
- file name could be better
- put some logic to take URL as input parameter.
- write own logic to collect URLs from page instead of using Jsoup library.
